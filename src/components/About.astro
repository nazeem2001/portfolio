  <p>
    I am a dedicated Full Stack Developer with a passion for crafting responsive
    and efficient web applications. With over two years of hands-on experience
    in front-end development using Angular and React, I specialize in building
    intuitive user interfaces and seamless micro front-ends. My background
    includes delivering high-quality solutions for industry-leading clients like
    UPS, where I contributed to enhancing user engagement and overall site
    responsiveness.

  <p>
    I thrive in Agile environments, where I have developed a keen ability to
    manage complex projects, resolve challenging bugs, and deliver on tight
    schedules. My technical toolkit spans a wide range of technologies, from
    modern frameworks to cloud platforms, and I am continually focused on
    improving my skill set. I am particularly skilled in integrating front-end
    and back-end solutions using RESTful APIs and microservices architecture.

  <p>
    Driven by a love for problem-solving and innovation, I am always looking to
    push the boundaries of what's possible in web development. Whether working
    individually or collaborating with cross-functional teams, I am committed to
    delivering impactful, scalable solutions that address real-world needs.

  <p>
    When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends,
    contributing to open-source projects, or experimenting with new frameworks
    and design patterns. I am excited to bring my experience and enthusiasm to
    new challenges, helping businesses succeed in the digital landscape.
